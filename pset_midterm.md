# Problem Set For Mid Term

### Two-dimensional lists

1. Create a function that takes in a 2d list as a parameter. Your program should run through the list and print out each element along with its square root and cube root values in the 2d list. Assume that there are no loops nested more than two levels deep. 
  ```python
    def juicyPrinter(2d_lst):
      return #something
      
    Input: [ [2, 3, 4], [33, 22 ,11], [2, 100, 22, 78] ]
    Output: 
    Look! This is my number 2, 4, 8
    Look! This is my number 3, 9, 27
    Look! This is my number 4, 16, 64
    Look! This is my number 33, 1089, 35937
    Look! This is my number 22, 484, 10648
    Look! This is my number 11, 121, 1331
    Look! This is my number 2, 4, 8
    Look! This is my number 100, 10000, 1000000
    Look! This is my number 22, 484, 10648
    Look! This is my number 78, 6084, 474552
    
  ```
  
2. Create a function that takes in four 2d lists as parameters. Your program should multiply all the corresponding numbers in the rows and return a final matrix of the products. 
``` python
  def multiplier(a, b, c, d):
    return #a matrix/2d list
    
  Input:
    a = [ [1, 2, 3], [5, 3, 2], [4, 3, 2] ]
    b = [ [2, 3, 1], [4, 4, 4], [2, 7, 3] ]
    c = [ [2, 3, 4], [2, 3, 4], [2, 1, 1] ]
    d = [ [2, 2, 2], [3, 3, 3], [1, 1, 1] ]
    
  Output: 
    [ [8, 36, 24], [120, 108, 96], [16, 21, 6] ]
```
