## Practice Problems

##### While loops
*Remember to use while loops in all the solutions!* <br><br>


1. Define a function take takes an integer as an input, and returns a list with all even numbers up to and including that input. Restrictions: Use a while loop

2. Define a function that takes a string as its first parameter and an integer as its second parameter. The function should print the string reversed "x" number of times. In this case, "x" is the second paramter. 

3. Define a function that takes an integer "num" as its first parameter and a list "lst" as its second parameter. The function will return the number of times the integer "num" occurs in the list. 

4. Define a function that takes an integer "num" as it's first parameter and a list "lst" as its second parameter. The function should return true if the integer "num" exists in the list "lst". 

5. Define a function that takes a list "lst1" and another list "lst2" as its first and second parameter respectively. The function should return a list with only the unique elements between the two lists. 

  ```python
  # The following function call should return ["charlie", "tango", 1, 99, 90, 47, "bears"]. Notice all of the elements in the final list are unique.
  
  uniques(["charlie", "tango", 1, 99, 90, 99, "tango"], ["charlie", "tango", 47, "bears"])
  ```

6. Define a function that takes an integer "num" as an input and returns the sum of all uneven numbers till that integer "num". Note: We want the sum of all the numbers that are not even. 

7. Define a function that takes a list as its parameter and returns True/False based on if the list is strictly increasing or decreasing. 

  ```python
  #For example, 
  #[1, 3, 6, 9, 11, 99, 666] should return true
  #[44, 43, r17, 12, 9, 3] should return true
  #[3, 2, 4] should return false
  ```
8. Do the fibonacci sequnce :D . You are more than ready!!!
